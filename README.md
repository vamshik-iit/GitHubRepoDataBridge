# GitHubRepoDataBridge

Overview:

GitHubRepoDataBridge is an innovative data management tool designed to streamline the process of extracting, transforming, and loading GitHub repository data. This project focuses on efficiently retrieving data from GitHub, storing it in EdgeDB, and then transferring it to Milvus, a vector database. It's an end-to-end solution for handling GitHub data with accuracy and speed.

Key Features:

Data Extraction: Leverages Python and the GitHub API for retrieving repository data, including issues, commits, and other relevant metrics.
Database Integration: Utilizes EdgeDB for efficient data storage and management, ensuring data integrity and easy retrieval.
Data Migration to Vector Database: Incorporates functionality to transfer stored data from EdgeDB to Milvus, facilitating advanced data analysis and machine learning applications.
Time Efficiency Analysis: Compares the time required to collect data over different periods (1 month vs. 1 year), providing insights into the scalability and performance of the data extraction process.
Unit Testing with Sample Data: Includes a module for collecting a weekâ€™s worth of data for specified repositories for testing and debugging purposes.
Scalable Data Handling: Designed to handle data collection for an extended period (e.g., 1 year), making it suitable for long-term data analysis projects.


Application:

This tool is ideal for data analysts, researchers, and developers who require comprehensive and detailed data from GitHub repositories for analysis, predictive modeling, or machine learning projects.
